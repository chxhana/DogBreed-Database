# DogBreed-Database
 The Dog Breed Database allows you to research and learn about different dog breeds. It was created using SQL and Python, and includes a dog breed database table in MySQL Workbench.
 

To run this app, you will need:

1. Python 3

2. MySQL Workbench

You need to import the dogbreed.sql file into MySQL Workbench to create the dog breed database table and update the database connection information in the config.py file.

The app will prompt you to enter the name of a dog breed to search for. If the breed is found in the database, it will display the information. If the breed is not found, user can add the breed and relevant information to the database.
